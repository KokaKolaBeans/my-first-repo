Ã§y# Orwell - An Overview of Style, Prose, and Construction

To some extent, much of great modern literature is an art of withholding
 
Orwell continues to come back to Kopp's situation as a narrative anchor-point throughout the final sections of the story. 
we are held in a constant state of suspension - will Kopp make it out or  not? At each turn there is a new opportunity 
whereby the tables might turn, but I am slowly led to the creeping realization that things won't ultimately work out. The 
fundamental decency of the Spanish national character is another theme throughout the ending bit. These points help to breathe life into a narrative otherwise filled with regret, contempt, and longing. It is the admixture of elements- both the
struggles and underlying humanity - that creates a narrative arch both compelling and heartbreaking throughout. Orwell displays a sardonic wit. His lack of decorative modifiers creates a pervading sense of neutrality that somehow coexists
in portions of the book with the narrator's rage. Orwell's crystalline prose, devoid of excessive tonal valence and 
accoutrement allows the reader to experience Orwell's world as if through his own eyes, creating his own images and drawing his
own judgements quite independent of the narrator himself. The tone, however, becomes more despeerate -- sadd and darker -- in the book's final chapters

I remember eading an interview with Yann Martel years ago wherein he described the experienc eof writing a book and then, later, realizing it just wasn't working. All the obvious bit of goo writing seemd present, but there was some fundamental underlying *living* quality missing from the work.

Orwell is the first writer I read that seemed, in the simplicity of his prose, to lay bare the inner mechanics of beautiful prose. So too have poets, like.... The poetry of, say.., feels to me less like a liviing, breathing artificat than simply a succession of useful interesting images,

As someone who, at the end of the day, knows very little about writing, I am fascinated by the ethereal elements that transogrify beautiful language into a living, breathing world.
